# Experimental App for Feature Testing

This application was developed to test critical features for an upcoming V2 of an app assigned to me by my work. It served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to gain further expertise in native app development.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

You can run the app on various environments:

- [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

## Development

You can begin development by modifying files inside the **app** directory. This project follows [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).

## Resetting the Project

If needed, you can reset the project by running:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a new **app** directory for fresh development.
